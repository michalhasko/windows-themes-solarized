# Solarized themes for Windows

This is a port of the Ethan Schoonover's
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme for Windows
classic look. I don't normally use Windows, but I am forced to use it at work.
So I created this theme to make my misery a little bit more pleasant. Please
feel free to use the theme, fork the repo, or contribute to it.

**Warning:**
The theme is in alpha version. I have only tested it on Windows 7 64bit. Use
at your own risk, I am not liable for any damage / data loss on your computer.
